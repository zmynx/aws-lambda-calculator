# Introduction

## Back story

This project is the fruits of a hackaton idea I had about a year ago:\
The original idea was to provide users with a system to decide whether to go with the lambda serverless solution, or follow the more scallable kubernetes based solutions\.To do that, I needed a cost estimation for both solutions using the same configurations.\
*I couldn't find a single calculator to support all configuration range values.*

## The short version...

> Try to calculation a 10GB memory-use Lambda function, you simply can't. Calculators are capped somewhere in the 3GiB range.

Born as a result of a need to have a near accurate cost estination for Lambda functions on the AWS cloud. While doing some research Ive discovered the following:

1. The available calculators are limited, and does NOT allow for the wide range of configurations Lambda offers today. 
2. There is no API available (as-of-today) to allow to scripted / non-web based invokactions. This seriously reduces the changes of suchs calculators to be part of a FinOps tool / platform.

# The goals

Several goals are set for this project:\
1. Python package.
2. API.
3. Binary.
4. Docker Image.
5. Serverless based API (Lambda + Api gateway).
6. Web-based solution, using GitHub Pages.

# Installation
### 1. Python Package

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/zMynx/aws-lambda-calculator.git#egg=aws-lambda-calculator
```

### 2. API

```bash
## Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/zMynx/aws-lambda-calculator.git

## Install the requirements
python -m pip install --requirementes requirements.txt
```

### 3. CLI

```bash
## Use the setup script
curl --remote-name https://github.com/zMynx/aws-lambda-calculator/blob/main/run.sh

## Run the setup.sh script
bash ./run.sh
```

### 4. Docker image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/zMynx/aws-lambda-calculator:latest
```

# Usage
Complete the [installation](#installation) steps first, then,

### 1. Python Package

```python
import aws-lambda-calculator
```

### 2. API

```bash
python ./main.py --key=value....
```

### 3. CLI

```bash
aws-lambda-calculator --key=value....
```

### 4. Docker image

If you wish to use the API on any platform, without installing the binary, use the docker image.

```bash
## Pull & use the image based api locally
docker run \
    --name aws-lambda-calculator \
    --interactive \
    --tty \
    --rm \
    --pull \
    --tag ghcr.io/zMynx/aws-lambda-calculator:latest \
    --args key=value...
```

### 5. Serverless API

The serverless API solution is based on a Lambda function, and can be used by invoking the endpoint, while providing a payload of the configurations to use.\
Endpoint: `https://zmynx.aws-lambda-calculator.com`

e.g. (example using the cli)
```bash
curl \
    --data '{"payload":{"key":"value"}}' \
    https://zmynx.aws-lambda-calculator.com
```

### 6. Web based solution

Navigate to `https://github.com/zMynx/aws-lambda-calculator.io`.
